# Day 20

🎯 Day 20 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🧠 Text Analyzer Tool with Word Cloud (Python)

Today, I built a quick but powerful NLP tool that analyzes .txt files to extract key insights from unstructured text.

✅ What I accomplished:

  - 📄 Uploaded a .txt file (in this case, good old Lorem Ipsum)

  - 🔍 Tokenized and cleaned the text using NLTK

  - 📊 Calculated:

    - Total word count

    - Average sentence length

    - Top 10 most frequent words

  - ☁️ Generated a Word Cloud to highlight the most common words visually


This project was a great way to practice text preprocessing and basic natural language analysis — perfect for blog content, reports, or early-stage NLP workflows.


💡 Next step? Hook it up to a web app with Streamlit for an interactive text analysis tool!

📂 Tools: NLTK, matplotlib, wordcloud, Jupyter Notebook
